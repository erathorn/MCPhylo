    Base.read(name::AbstractString, ::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractChains}

Read a chain from an external file.

Returns an `AbstractChains` subtype read from an external file.

* `name` : file to read or write. Recommended convention is for the file name to be specified with a `.jls` extension.

* `T` : chain type to read.

* `c` : chain to write.

Write a chain to an external file.

Returns a written external file containing a subtype.

    readcoda(output::AbstractString, index::AbstractString)

Read MCMC sampler output generated in the CODA format by OpenBUGS. The function only retains those sampler iterations at which all model parameters were monitored.

Returns a `Chains` object containing the read sampler output.

* `output` : text file containing the iteration numbers and sampled values for the model parameters.

* `index` : text file containing the names of the parameters, followed by the first and last rows in which their output can be found in the `output` file.
