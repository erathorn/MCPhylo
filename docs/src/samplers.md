## abc

Main.MCPhylo.ABC
```
#### Arguments

* `params`: stochastic node(s) to be updated with the sampler.  Constrained parameters are mapped to unconstrained space according to transformations defined by the Stochastic `unlist()` function.

* `scale` : scaling value or vector of the same length as the combined elements of nodes `params` for the `proposal` distribution.  Values are relative to the unconstrained parameter space, where candidate draws are generated.

* `summary` : function that takes a vector of observed or simulated data and returns a summary statistic or vector of statistics.

* `epsilon` : target tolerance for determining how similar observed and simulated data summary statistics need to be in order to accept a candidate draw.

* `kernel` : weighting kernel density of type `Biweight`, `Cosine`, `Epanechnikov`, `Normal`, `SymTriangularDist`, `SymUniform`, or `Triweight` to use in measuring similarity between observed and simulated data summary statistics.  Specified `epsilon` determines the standard deviation of Normal kernels and widths of the others.

* `dist` : positive function for the kernel density to compute distance between vectors of observed (`Tobs`) and simulated (`Tsim`) data summary statistics (default: Euclidean distance).

* `proposal` : symmetric distribution of type `Biweight`, `Cosine`, `Epanechnikov`, `Normal`, `SymTriangularDist`, `SymUniform`, or `Triweight` to be centered around current parameter values and used to generate proposal draws.  Specified `scale` determines the standard deviations of Normal proposals and widths of the others.

* `maxdraw` : maximum number of unaccepted candidates to draw in each call of the sampler.  Draws are generated until one is accepted or the maximum is reached.  Larger values increase acceptance rates at the expense of longer runtimes.

* `nsim` : number of data sets to simulate in deciding whether to accept a candidate draw.  Larger values lead to closer approximations of the target distribution at the expense of longer runtimes.

* `decay` : if `0 < decay <= 1`, the rate at which internal tolerances are monotonically decreased from the initial distance between observed and simulated summary statistics toward the maximum of each subsequent distance and `epsilon`; if `decay = 0`, internal tolerances are fixed at `epsilon`.

* `randeps` : whether to perturb internal tolerances by random exponential variates.

* `args...` : additional keyword arguments to be passed to the `dist` function.

## slicesimplex.jl

```

#### Arguments

* `params`: stochastic node(s) to be updated with the sampler.

* `args...`: additional keyword arguments to be passed to the `SliceSimplexVariate` constructor.

## sampler.jl

```@docs
Main.MCPhylo.Sampler
```

#### Arguments

* `params`: node(s) being block-updated by the sampler.

* `f`: function for the `eval` field of the constructed sampler and whose arguments are the other model nodes upon which the sampler depends, typed argument `model::Model` that contains all model nodes, and/or typed argument `block::Integer` that is an index identifying the corresponding sampling function in a vector of all samplers for the associated model. Through the arguments, all model nodes and fields can be accessed in the body of the function. The function may return an updated sample for the nodes identified in its `params` field. Such a return value can be a structure of the same type as the node if the block consists of only one node, or a dictionary of node structures with keys equal to the block node symbols if one or more. Alternatively, a value of `nothing` may be returned. Return values that are not `nothing` will be used to automatically update the node values and propagate them to dependent nodes. No automatic updating will be done if `nothing` is returned.

* `tune`: tuning parameters needed by the sampling function.
